					<h4>Orgic is an experiment in the abolition of the division of labor.</h4>
					<ol type="a">
						<li><p>This is not performed through a centralized redistribution of labor as Guattari attempted with La Borde, but rather;</p></li>
						<li><p>Everyone is encouraged to follow their own inclinations, and thus;</p></li>
						<li><p>For us, <i>abolishing the division of labor</i> takes place at the meeting point between Rabelais’ <i>fay ce que vouldras</i> and Spinoza’s <i>what a body can do;</i></p></li>

							<ol type="i">

			<h5> DEFINITIONS </h5>
			<ol type="I">
				<li><p>By division of labor we understand a productive activity in which one is alienated from their creativity.</p></li>
				<li><p>That action is called <i>monetization</i> which produces for the purpose of exchanging its product for capital.</p></li>
				<li>
					<p>By collective creativity we understand that process through which singular people, each according to their own capacities, come together to create something new</p>
					<p class="indent">
						<i>Explanation.</i> No equality exists among humans: we are not equal, we are different. Each singular human has their own different capabilities and
						inclinations. Whenever one pursues their inclinations and capabilities, whenever they <i>do what they can</i>, their activity does not consist in a 
						division of labor; it is, rather, in the free realization of their form-of-life.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h5> AXIOMS </h5>
			<ol>
				<li><p>What is created is either created for itself, or it is produced for the purpose of something else.</p></li>
				<li><p>That which does not produce for the purpose of something else, must create for itself.</p></li>
				<li><p>From an absence of purpose, creation neccesarily follows; and, on the other hand, if a capitalist purpose is given, it is impossible that creation can follow.</p></li>
				<li><p>Creation can only happen if it is removed from monetization and the division of labor.</p></li>
				<li><p>The pursuit of singular creativity is only possible through community.</p></li>
				<li><p>Community can only exist as a decision process achieved through discussion and consensus, never debate and voting.</p></li>
				<li>
					<p>The division of labor prevents both community and creativity</p>
					<p class="indent">
						<i>Corollary.</i> Hence, it follows that <i>Orgic</i> encourages the pursuit of one's singular capabilities, while preventing, at the same time, a division
						of labor. This means that while <i>creation</i> will often be entirely singular, <i>editing</i> must always be collective.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h5> PROPOSITIONS </h5>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						All propositions and modes of organization and action, with the exclusion of our axioms, are subject to constant change. These are not laws, but
						reflections of our current general consensus.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Submissions are accepted in any form of media, and there are no deadlines. Currently, the agreed upon threshold of standing submissions before the
						review process is ten. This review process is conducted on each of the ten pieces by all ten members of the submission group, with the exclusion of
						the primary creator(s) of the work currently in question. Any submission without a creator present is automatically disqualified from consideration.
						The quantity of submissions accepted and declined, though works which the group believes has good potential may be declined with suggestions and asked
						for resubmittal in the future.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						After the review process, those works which have been accepted form the body of drafts for the next edition. Times are scheduled for the collective
						editing process, where all contributors, including the creator, engage in creative critique to expand and improve the works in question until all
						contributors have reached a consensus that it is of the highest quality. Once this consensus is reached, all works in their finalized form are
						released as the <i>n</i>th edition.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Authorship is neither encouraged nor discouraged, though the process of collective editiing naturally places considerable importance away from the
						original author.
					</p>
				</li>

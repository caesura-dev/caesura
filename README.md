# Caesura website project

This repository is intended as the main source code behind the Caesura project. More details about the nature of the project will be added later.

For details on contributing to the project contact [caesuradev@protonmail.com](caesuradev@protonmail.com)

## Contribution guidelines

For developers contributing to the project, follow [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) where applicable. In broad strokes contributing to the project should be as follows:

    1. Create a new branch for your feature
    2. Commit all new code to your branch
    3. When finished, create a pull request against the main branch
    4. Request code review from other developers
    5. Wait for automated tests (if any) to complete
    6. After PR is green (all tests passed, code reviewed by at least one other developer) merge branch into main and delete your working branch.

For branch names, keep them succinct but descriptive of the work done, e.g. "add-dark-mode"

### Tracking tasks

Tracking tasks is done with "Dev work" kanban table in the Projects tab of the repository. Whenever new tasks arise, add them as cards to the "To do" column with a short title and description of what needs to be done. Cards should ideally have at least one assignee to keep the possibility of clashing work (two people doing the same task) as low as possible. Prefer small tasks over large contributions.
